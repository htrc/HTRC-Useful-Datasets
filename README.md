Useful datasets
------------------

This repo collects and documents various useful datasets related to the HathiTrust or the HathiTrust Research Center.

Note, in many cases the datasets themselves are not checked in, just their docs, code, and samples. Contact the HTRC if you'd like access to any of them.
